            You confirm your intention to transact electronically and acknowledge that all agreements and communications executed in this format are valid.

          Account Setup & Access to Services
        </h1>

        <section className="space-y-4 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Creating an Account</h2>
          <p>
            While anyone can browse the public pages of our website, access to our services requires the creation and activation of an account.
          </p>

          <p>To set up your account:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Complete the online order forms provided by Livexcellence.</li>
            <li>Follow the provided instructions to submit your subscription request.</li>
            <li>Confirm that you are at least 18 years of age.</li>
            <li>Create a unique username and password.</li>
            <li>Provide a valid email address.</li>
            <li>Agree to these Terms of Service and any additional terms outlined during the setup process.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            By selecting "I agree", and if you meet the eligibility requirements, your account will be activated. If you select "I do not agree" or fail to meet the criteria, your account will not be activated and access to our services will be denied.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Account Activation</h2>
          <p>
            Livexcellence reserves the right to deny account activation at its sole discretion, without providing a reason. Upon successful activation, you will receive a confirmation email. Once activation steps are complete, you will be able to log in and access the services, including features applicable to your subscription level.
          </p>

          <p>By activating your account, you confirm:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>You have read and understand these Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>You agree to be legally bound by them.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Additionally:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Some services are subject to additional terms and user limitations, as detailed in your order.</li>
            <li>Services are limited to the number of devices specified in your subscription. Adding more devices requires a separate order.</li>
            <li>Services are provided "as is" and are not contingent on future updates or features unless explicitly stated in the order.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Password Security</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password.</li>
            <li>You are liable for all activity under your account, whether authorized or not.</li>
            <li>If your password is lost, stolen, or compromised, notify Livexcellence immediately.</li>
            <li>You will only have access to services and areas that Livexcellence has authorized.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Account Information Requirements</h2>
          <p>As a condition of using our services, you agree to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during account setup.</li>
            <li>Promptly update this information as needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Providing false, outdated, or incomplete information—or if Livexcellence suspects such—is grounds for account suspension or termination. This may also result in denial of current or future access to the services or website.

            Accessing Services Through the Livexcellence Client
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Client Overview</h3>
          <p>
            We offer the Livexcellence client applet ("the client") as a tool to enhance your experience by streamlining access to our advisory services.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>The client performs initial system analysis (e.g., internet speed, security settings, drivers).</li>
            <li>It creates your profile and detects connected hardware to begin and manage system optimizations.</li>
            <li>Full functionality is unlocked only with a valid subscription.</li>
            <li>The client includes a third-party component, cpuidsdk.dll, from CPUID EURL to improve performance recommendations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Installation and Deactivation</h3>
          <p>
            You may deactivate the client at any time using your operating system’s standard procedures:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Windows:</strong> Go to Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Programs, select “Livexcellence,” and click “Change/Remove.”
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Deactivation may leave behind harmless residual files or registry entries, which can be removed manually. Examples:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Windows XP:</strong>
            <br />
            Downloads – C:\Documents and Settings\*username*\My Documents\Downloads\Livexcellence
            <br />
            License – C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Livexcellence\Livexcellence\dd.lic
          </p>

          <p className="w-full overflow-x-scroll">
            <strong>Windows Vista and above:</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Downloads –  C:\Users\*username*\Downloads\Livexcellence
            <br />
            <br />
            License –  C:\ProgramData\Livexcellence\Livexcellence\dd.lic
          </p>

          <p>
            To remove .NET libraries used by the client, go to Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Programs, select Microsoft .NET 2.0, and click “Change/Remove.”
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Usage Rights and Restrictions</h2>
          <p>By accepting these Terms of Service:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>You are granted a license to use the client on the number of computers specified in your subscription.</li>
            <li>You may not:
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or modify the client.</li>
                <li>Attempt to discover its source code or create derivative works.</li>
                <li>Use it to clone system configurations across multiple machines.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The client is subject to U.S. export laws:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>It cannot be exported to embargoed countries or individuals on U.S. government-restricted lists.</li>
            <li>If you are downloading or using the client on behalf of the U.S. Government, it is subject to restricted rights under applicable federal regulations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Client Updates and Performance</h2>
          <p>The client is regularly updated to support ongoing service delivery. By using our services, you:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Consent to receive automatic client updates without additional notice.</li>
            <li>Understand that Livexcellence does not guarantee compatibility with your devices.</li>
            <li>Acknowledge that Livexcellence is not liable for device performance or functionality issues.</li>
            <li>Agree to contact your device manufacturer or vendor for hardware-related issues.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If your device is sold, lost, or stolen, promptly deactivate it from your account. Failing to log out of your account may allow unauthorized access to your services or account information.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Termination and Restrictions</h2>
          <p>
            Livexcellence reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account, without notice or compensation, if:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>You violate any Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>You misuse or engage in illegal activities involving the services or the client.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>


        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">
          Using Live Technical Support Assistance to Access Services
        </h1>

        <section className="space-y-4 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          <p>
            You can contact our live technical support agents by phone if you have an active, paid subscription to the services. These agents can often provide remote diagnostics, where, with your consent, the technician accesses your devices remotely through a proxy connection.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may either call a technician directly or schedule a support call in advance. The technician will request the email address associated with your account. To be eligible for support, you must ensure:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Our agents have full access to the devices, local area network, or system experiencing the issue.</li>
            <li>You have a valid, active subscription in good standing for the affected devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You must also have your own internet connection. All supported hardware (as defined below) must be connected to a high-speed internet connection for the services to function properly. Dial-up and satellite internet connections are not supported and do not meet the minimum requirements for remote access through Livexcellence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Livexcellence aims to make support services available 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding recognized legal holidays. However, service availability may be temporarily interrupted at times. For support requests that fall outside the scope of services defined in these Terms of Service, Livexcellence may offer additional support via phone agents for an extra fee.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our agents support both desktops and notebooks running Microsoft® Windows operating systems, collectively referred to as "supported PCs." The following software and applications are supported in publicly available versions:
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Supported Operating Systems:</h2>

            <li>Some spyware or virus removal processes may affect certain programs’ performance.</li>
            <li>Removal actions may be restricted by software licenses, and it's your responsibility to review these before proceeding.</li>
            <li>While we aim to remove spyware and viruses, we cannot guarantee that new threats will not reappear on your devices or network after service.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-4">
          Subscriptions, Billing, and Cancellation
        </h1>

        <section className="space-y-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Ongoing Subscriptions:</h2>
          <p>
            Your Livexcellence subscription will automatically renew either monthly or annually—depending on your initial purchase—unless you cancel it or we terminate it. If your subscription started with a reduced introductory price, you will be charged the full subscription rate once the introductory period ends, as disclosed at the time of purchase. To use the Services, you must have internet access and provide a valid, accepted, and current payment method (referred to as "Payment Method"), which you may update at any time. We will charge your selected subscription fee to your Payment Method based on the term you chose. To avoid being charged for the next subscription term, you must cancel before the auto-renewal date, according to the term you initially selected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be aware that applicable taxes may be included in your subscription charge depending on local laws. In some regions, sales tax may apply; if not collected, you may still be responsible for submitting use tax or other similar taxes. If it is later determined that sales tax should have been collected for your region, we will apply that charge to your account.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Different Subscription Plans:</h2>
          <p>
            We may offer various subscription plans, including promotional offers or plans with unique terms and conditions. Any significant differences from the terms outlined in these Terms of Service will be clearly disclosed to you during sign-up, in your order, or through our communications. You can access specific details about your Livexcellence subscription by visiting our website and clicking on the “Your Account” link. We reserve the right to modify, discontinue, or otherwise change the subscription plans at our sole discretion.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Recurring Billing:</h2>
          <p>
            By starting your Livexcellence subscription and providing a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method at the then-current rate—monthly or annually depending on your selected term—and to include any other charges related to your use of Livexcellence. You agree that the amount charged may vary from term to term due to factors such as promotional offers, redeemed gift cards or promo codes, or plan upgrades. You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for any such changes, which may be billed as one or multiple charges per billing cycle.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Price Changes:</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to change the pricing of our services, or any parts thereof, at any time and at our sole discretion. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, you will be notified of any price changes by email before they take effect.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Billing Cycle:</h2>
          <p>
            Subscription fees will be charged at the beginning of each paid subscription period and will automatically continue on each billing cycle until cancellation. Your Payment Method will be billed on the same calendar day that your subscription originally began. Subscription fees are deemed earned once paid. We may modify your billing schedule if there are issues processing your payment. If your subscription starts on a date that does not occur in a future month (e.g., January 31), we may charge your Payment Method on the closest applicable date (e.g., February 28). Any changes to your subscription may alter your renewal date. To find your next renewal date, go to the “Your Account” page and click “View billing details.” We may pre-authorize your Payment Method for upcoming charges. In these Terms, “billing” refers to all processes of charging, debiting, or collecting payments from your Payment Method. The terms “monthly,” “annually,” or “term” refer to your billing cycle unless otherwise indicated.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">No Refunds:</h2>
          <p>
            All payments are non-refundable. We do not issue refunds or credits for partial subscription periods. After cancellation, you will retain access to the service until the end of your current billing period. In some cases, we may choose—at our sole discretion—to issue refunds, credits, or discounts. The amount, type, and issuance of such credits are entirely up to us and do not establish any obligation to provide similar compensation in the future.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Cancellation:</h2>
          <p>
            You may cancel your Livexcellence subscription at any time. Access to the service will continue until the end of your current billing cycle. WE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIAL PERIODS. To cancel, go to the “Your Account” page on our website and follow the cancellation steps. Your account will automatically close at the end of your billing period. For specific closure dates, click “View billing details” in your account settings.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Subscriber Eligibility and Use of Services</h2>
          <p>
            To be eligible for a subscription, you must be at least 18 years old or have reached the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction. Individuals under 18 may only use the service under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who manages the account and agrees to these Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Livexcellence Client and Services solely for personal, non-commercial purposes during your subscription term. This license includes access to updates, optimizations, and service improvements. You do not receive any additional rights or ownership beyond this limited license.
          </p>

          <p>
            We regularly update and test our services, including the Client. These tests may include changes to the website, interface, service quality, subscription plans, features, and more. You agree that you may be included or excluded from such tests at our discretion and without prior notice. We may modify or adjust our Services at any time.
          </p>

          <p>
            By using the Services, you agree to follow all applicable laws, regulations, and usage restrictions. You agree not to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Archive, download (except temporary caching), reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, or create derivative works based on Livexcellence’s content or services.</li>
            <li>Circumvent, remove, or tamper with any content protection features.</li>
            <li>Use automated tools like robots, spiders, or scrapers.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer or disassemble any software used in the Services.</li>
            <li>Modify the Service’s code or use data mining tools.</li>
            <li>Upload or transmit malicious software, including viruses.</li>
            <li>Use the Services to create competing products or to copy Livexcellence’s features or design.</li>
            <li>Share, resell, or lease the Services to third parties.</li>
            <li>Store or transmit illegal, infringing, or privacy-violating content.</li>
            <li>Interfere with Service performance or data integrity.</li>
            <li>Impersonate someone else or gain unauthorized access to the Services or other users’ devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you violate these Terms, Livexcellence may issue warnings, suspend services, or terminate your account at its sole discretion.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Passwords and Account Access</h2>
          <p>
            The person who creates the Livexcellence account and provides the Payment Method is considered the Account Owner, who maintains control over the account through their password. To maintain exclusive control, you should not share your password or Payment Method details (e.g., card’s last four digits or PayPal email) with others.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're accepting these Terms on behalf of a company or legal entity, you affirm that you have the authority to bind that entity. If you don’t have such authority or don’t agree to these Terms, do not proceed with use.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use technology that helps recognize you as the Account Owner to facilitate seamless access, meaning you may not need to re-enter your password on Livexcellence-ready devices or our website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be cautious of any request asking for your Payment Method or account information. These may be attempts at identity theft. Always manage your account directly through the official Livexcellence site. Livexcellence may suspend accounts at any time to protect itself and its partners from suspected fraud. Refunds or credits will not be issued for accounts suspended due to such activity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Disclaimers of Warranties and Limitations of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            Livexcellence services—including the Client and all content and features—are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted use. Except as otherwise stated, Livexcellence disclaims all express or implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and quiet enjoyment.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, Livexcellence, its affiliates, and their employees or licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages—including lost profits, data loss, or business interruption—even if previously advised of such possibilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain jurisdictions may not allow the limitation or exclusion of some liabilities, in which case these limitations may not fully apply to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. These limitations are essential to the agreement between you and Livexcellence.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms and all related transactions are governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., regardless of conflict of law rules. You may also have specific consumer rights under local laws that are not affected by these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Intellectual Property</h2>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Arbitration of Claims</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please read this carefully. It’s important to understand how it affects your rights.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At Livexcellence, we strive to ensure that our outstanding service team can resolve most issues you may experience while using our services. You can visit our help center for answers to common questions or contact our customer service team for assistance. In the rare event that a problem remains unresolved, we believe in setting clear expectations from the outset to avoid confusion later. Therefore, both you and Livexcellence agree to the resolution process described below.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You and Livexcellence agree to first attempt to resolve any issue informally for a minimum of 30 days to reach the quickest and most efficient resolution possible. To initiate this, please send an email to Livexcellence at:
        Livexcellence, 154 W Foothill Blvd Ste A, Upland, CA 91786 — Attn: Legal Department.
        Be sure to include your full name, contact information, and your proposed resolution. If we need to contact you, we will reach out using the email address associated with your Livexcellence account.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If after at least 30 days of informal communication we are unable to come to an agreement, you and Livexcellence agree to resolve any claim (arising from or related to these terms—including their formation, performance, or breach—our relationship, or your use of the services) through binding arbitration. This arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, which you can access here
        .
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, Livexcellence permits you to bring a claim in small claims court as long as you proceed on an individual basis. This is an exception to the arbitration agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To ensure a timely resolution, both parties agree that any arbitration must begin within one year from when the claim arises. Any claim not brought within that timeframe will be considered waived. Furthermore, both parties agree to arbitrate only on an individual basis and not to participate in any class actions. Each of us explicitly waives any right to file or participate in a class action or seek relief on a class-wide basis.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">All arbitration hearings will take place in Upland, California.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You can download or print a form notice and arbitration initiation form at www.adr.org
        . If you initiate arbitration, your fees will be limited to the filing fee outlined in the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. Livexcellence will cover all other arbitration-related fees, including your portion of the arbitrator’s compensation, regardless of who initiates the process.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please note: the arbitrator's decision is final and can be enforced in any court with appropriate jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you're uncertain about any of these terms, we recommend consulting an attorney.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We understand that discussing potential problems may not be ideal, but we are committed to transparency. We appreciate your understanding of the importance of this process and your agreement with the terms outlined here.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Survival Clause:</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        If any portion of these terms of service is found to be void, unlawful, or unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain valid, lawful, and enforceable.

Please note that fully disabling cookies may impact the functionality of Livexcellence websites.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Livexcellence and its business partners use cookies for various purposes, such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Verifying your identity on our websites so we can deliver the services you requested</li>
        <li>Preserving data you've provided, like items in your shopping cart on https://www.livexcellence.net</li>
        <li>Delivering the websites and services you use on Livexcellence</li>
        <li>Remembering your preferences or where you left off when using an Livexcellence website</li>
        <li>Monitoring how you use Livexcellence websites to improve them, tailoring the experience to your interests, and conducting market research</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Technologies Similar to Cookies</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While HTTP cookies are the most commonly known, there are other similar technologies like HTML5 Local Storage and Local Shared Objects (LSOs). Livexcellence and the websites hosting its files may use these technologies to verify your identity, store provided information, and remember your settings as described above.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you're using an Livexcellence application offline, we may store website usage data on your device, which will be synchronized with our servers once you're back online.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Hidden Programs can Web Beacons</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We also utilize web beacons and embedded scripts in our emails and advertisements, among other technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Web beacons (or “tags”) are small pieces of code in emails, ads, or web pages that notify Livexcellence (or the companies assisting us) when these are viewed or clicked.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Embedded scripts are code snippets used in certain web pages to track your interactions (e.g., clicking links). This data helps us improve our websites, tailor content to your interests, and perform market research. You may be able to disable scripting in your browser settings (refer to your browser’s help section), but note that doing so may impact how some Livexcellence websites function.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Livexcellence and social networking</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please be aware that any personal information you share via social networking platforms may be collected, accessed, and used by Livexcellence and others. The handling of your data on these platforms is governed by the privacy policy of the specific social network.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Livexcellence may collect information about you through social networks in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>When you sign into an Livexcellence app or website using your social network account (e.g., Facebook), this may help create your Livexcellence account</li>
        <li>When you use an Livexcellence app on a social network or interact with an Livexcellence page (e.g., by liking or joining), the platform may share information about you with Livexcellence. Refer to the social network’s privacy policy for details</li>
        <li>When you interact with Livexcellence social content, we may use cookies to track your clicks</li>
        <li>If your social network profile is public, Livexcellence may be able to see that information</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For privacy policies regarding social networking services you use with Livexcellence, please review the respective platforms' privacy documentation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Communications from Livexcellence</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may contact you in different ways—for example, to inform you about new Livexcellence apps or features we think may interest you.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Email, Phone, and Mail Marketing</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you opt to receive marketing communications from us via email, phone, or postal mail, we aim to tailor these messages based on your interests. We track email opens to measure effectiveness and provide personalized product and service suggestions based on your usage.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you're a business customer who has consented to receive Livexcellence marketing, we may share your information with our resellers and sales partners. We do not share personal consumer data with third parties for their own marketing use unless we have your explicit consent.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
        Tailoring Livexcellence Apps and Websites to your interests
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may present content, promotions, or suggestions on Livexcellence websites and apps based on your presumed interests.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Interest-Based Advertising</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Livexcellence runs online ad campaigns that tailor ads to your interests. We gather insights from your interactions with our apps and websites and may also use data from other companies to better understand your preferences across non-Livexcellence sites and apps.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These personalized ads (also known as interest-based or behavioral advertising) appear on non-Livexcellence websites and apps via ad networks that may set their own cookies, web beacons, and identifiers. We and our partners collect data about which Livexcellence ads you see and interact with, and where they are shown.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Some of these networks also use technologies to recognize users across devices and browsers. This helps us show you personalized ads on other platforms based on how you use Livexcellence services.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you prefer not to receive interest-based ads outside of Livexcellence apps, adjust your mobile device settings to limit ad tracking.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Note that even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see Livexcellence advertisements elsewhere—but they won’t be personalized based on your interactions with Livexcellence.
      </p>

          <p>
            The U.S. Department of Commerce has established the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy
            Shield Frameworks, to which Livexcellence U.S. has certified in relation to the transfer

          <p>
            As outlined in our policy, if you are an individual user located outside of North
            America, your relationship is with Livexcellence, which acts as the “data controller” of
            your personal information collected by Livexcellence. Your personal information may be

            transfer mechanisms described above.

          <p>
            Regarding personal data processed on behalf of our business clients located in the EEA
            and Switzerland, Livexcellence typically functions as a "data processor" under EU data
