          </p>

          {/* Section 1: Easy Uninstallation */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Effortless Uninstallation</h2>

          {/* Section 2: Transparent Software Behavior */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Transparent Software Operations</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Our software is designed to clearly communicate its functions. Livexcellence scans for outdated or missing drivers and provides actionable steps to resolve issues efficiently.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>Livexcellence never installs third-party applications without consent.</li>
            <li>System settings remain unchanged unless explicitly approved by the user.</li>
            <li>Driver scans focus only on actual, relevant issues to prevent unnecessary confusion.</li>
            <li>The software’s operations are strictly limited to driver maintenance and system optimization.</li>
            <li>Full-license customers receive a complimentary walkthrough for their first driver installation guided by our support team, accessible via a dedicated phone line during checkout.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* Section 3: Data Privacy */}
          <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Livexcellence does not collect any personally identifiable information from your computer. Only hardware and software details are gathered to determine required driver updates accurately.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Why we gather device data:</strong> By collecting hardware and software inventory information, Livexcellence ensures our driver recommendations are precise. This data allows our system to continuously refine and standardize updates for all supported devices.
          </p>
